The field of 3D deep learning has witnessed a surge in research activity over the past decade. This has opened exciting possibilities for developing real-world applications. As someone with a strong background in machine learning and academic research, I'm particularly interested in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical software development in this space. My goal is to spend the next three years immersing myself in this technology, gaining a comprehensive understanding of its core concepts, and ultimately contributing impactful solutions to the 3D deep learning community.

This blog serves a dual purpose: first, to document my learning journey and share valuable insights with others.  I firmly believe in "learning-by-doing," and meticulously documenting my progress will serve as a powerful tool for solidifying my understanding.  This journey has been a long-time aspiration, and I hope to connect with others who share this passion.

Our exploration will begin with the fundamentals of building 3D deep learning software. We'll progressively build our skill set in analyzing 3D data and constructing robust 3D deep learning models.  While we will primarily utilize Jax as our foundational framework, we will also leverage existing libraries like [Open3D](https://www.open3d.org/), [PyTorch3D](https://pytorch3d.org/), and [TensorFlow3D](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/tf3d) for reference and learning purposes.

Complementing our practical endeavors, we will delve into the theoretical underpinnings of 3D deep learning. This exploration will encompass core concepts in computer vision and computer graphics, culminating in the cutting-edge research areas of generative 3D models and scene understanding. We will utilize established resources such as lectures from Stanford CS231a and CMU 16-825, along with relevant tutorials and workshops from recent conferences like CVPR and 3DV. While some workshops may focus on specific areas like urban 3D modeling and 3D product rendering, we can tailor our exploration to encompass a broader range of applications as we progress.

By actively documenting my journey through this blog, I hope to create a collaborative learning environment for others interested in this dynamic field. Through a combination of hands-on coding experience, theoretical exploration, and engagement with the broader research community, we can collectively unlock the transformative potential of 3D deep learning.

**If you've made it this far, I'd love to hear from you!** Please share your thoughts, questions, or areas of interest related to 3D deep learning. I'm excited to embark on this journey and eager to connect with others who share my passion.

To provide a clearer roadmap of my learning goals, I've outlined the following milestones with anticipated weekly blog updates:

* Month 3: Develop a strong foundation in Jax and gain proficiency in handling 3D data.
* Month 6: Successfully implement a state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D deep learning model from scratch and achieve comparable results on a standard benchmark dataset.
* Year 1: Build the core components of a Jax-based 3D library.
* Year 2: Actively participate in a relevant research challenge and strive for a top-tier ranking.
* Year 3: Develop a practical application leveraging 3D deep learning technology.

While these milestones serve as a general guide, I understand that the pace of learning and research can be dynamic. I'll adapt my plans as needed to ensure continuous growth and development.
